# Aesir
Aesir is a Zelda inspired top down action adventure game, set in Viking esque age, where you venture into dungeons, to find the sacred mcguffin pieces.
It features exciting and unique ideas such as; ~~Multiple Weapons~~, ~~Heavy and Emphasized Combat~~, ~~Challenging Bosses~~, ~~Viking Graves~~, ~~Deep and Immersive Story~~, ~~Graphics~~, ~~Gameplay~~, and of course: The true, and unquestioned meaning of life!

The Project is for our 4th semester computer science Game Development Elective, and is made with Unity Engine & C#
