# Aesir
Aesir is a Zelda inspired top down action adventure game, set in Viking esque age, where you venture into dungeons, to find the sacred mcguffin pieces.
It features exciting and unique ideas such as; ~~Multiple Weapons~~, ~~Heavy and Emphasized Combat~~, ~~Challenging Bosses~~, ~~Viking Graves~~, ~~Deep and Immersive Story~~, ~~Graphics~~, ~~Gameplay~~, and of course: The true, and unquestioned meaning of life!

The Project is for our 4th semester computer science Game Development Elective, and is made with Unity Engine & C#

The player is equipped with a mighty battle-axe  that required some serious strength to swing around! Therefore most attacks in the game will have a bit of ramp up-, and swing -time. Much like the dodge roll, the characters movement is locked to four directions while an attack is performed (though the swing arc should allow the player to attack enemies besides him).
